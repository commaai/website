<p>
  Each vehicle has a specific harness based on make, model and year. Each
  kit includes the following:
</p>
<ul>
  {% for part in standard_harness_parts %}
  <li>{{ part }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
<p>Exceptions to the above include:</p>
{% for name, parts in non_standard_harnesses.items() %}
<p><strong>{{ name }}</strong></p>
<ul>
  {% for part in parts %}
  <li>{{ part }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endfor %}
