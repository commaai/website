<h1>Come build the future</h1>
<h2>
<i>Solve self driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries</i>.
</h2>

<p>
We're building the robotics stack that will solve self driving cars, then eventually scales to all of robotics. We own our stack from shipping state of the art <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAWScxZuc0g&amp;pp=ygUQY29tbWEgY29uIGhhcmFsZA%3D%3D">machine learning models</a> trained on our own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJWsrPnfrgo">infrastructure</a>, building the <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot">operating system</a>, designing the <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/comma3X/">hardware</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-jdEgvLb-A">manufacturing</a> it.
</p>

<p>
Today, our fleet is the second largest after Tesla, and it's growing every month as more of the 10+ million compatible cars on the road come online.

We will win by continuing to ship a better product and better driving to our users. No hype, just shipping constant incremental progress until your comma reliably drives you to <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/taco-bell/">Taco Bell</a>.
</p>

<div class="divider"></div>
<p>
comma is 25 people across <a href="https://blog.comma.ai/refactoring-for-growth/">three teams</a>:
</p>

<p>
The <strong class="highlight-green">autonomy team</strong> builds the autonomous agent software, along with all of the infrastructure needed for that.
</p>
<p>
The <strong class="highlight-green">product team</strong> designs and manufactures the product, including the hardware, low-level software needed to run the agent software, as well the app.
</p>
<p>
The <strong class="highlight-green">operations team</strong> builds and maintains company infrastructure, including money, people, and logistics.
</p>
<p>
The operations and product teams work together to ship you the comma 3X, and the autonomy and product teams ship openpilot to run on your comma 3X.
</p>

<pre>
One meeting a week, two great meals a day, and people who have passed a very high bar to get hired.

Perks:
- Chef-prepared lunch and dinner
- On-site gym and yoga studio
- 24/7 access to the comma fleet of cars
- Health, dental, and vision insurance
- Flexible time off

<h2>Who we're looking for</h2>
<pre>
We don't care where, or even if, you went to school. We don't care if you have a traditional background.
We're just looking for people who can independently contribute to shipping openpilot.

We love a great GitHub, open source contributors, good projects, and competition winners. Prove your skills with one of these:
1. <a href="https://comma.ai/bounties">Bounties</a>: contribute to our open source projects while getting paid
2. <a href="https://comma.ai/leaderboard">Challenges</a>: we made challenges for design, controls, hardware, and more.
3. Relevant experience: got a bunch of cool projects to show off? send us your GitHub or portfolio

<h2>Applying</h2>
<pre><strong>1. Technical challenge</strong>
Choose any of the challenges from the <a href="https://comma.ai/leaderboard">leaderboard</a> or <a href="https://comma.ai/bounties">bounties</a>, solve it, then reach into work@comma.ai.

Alternatively, if you have good relevant projects or experience to show, email into work@comma.ai with those. The best projects are ones that we can download and poke around with.

<strong>2. Phone screen</strong>
Typically, we do two phone calls. A quick intro and screen, then an in-depth technical interview with a division head.

<strong>3. Paid Micro-internship</strong>
We'll fly you out to meet the team and work on a real problem for a few days. In most cases, the project will be scoped such that you'll ship it to real users by the end.

If all goes well, we'll make you a full-time job or internship offer.
