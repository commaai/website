*our smallest and most powerful device, available now for $999*
<!-- *Simultaneously the smallest and most powerful computer to live on your windshield.* -->

{% include figure.html url="/img/comma-four/windshield43.png" %}

comma four launched at [COMMA_CON 2025](https://youtu.be/M3BP6mKWX6M?t=5051) and packs the same compute, sensor suite, and functionality as comma 3X into a package one-fifth the size, making it the ideal form factor for your windshield.

If you drive one of 300+ [compatible cars](https://comma.ai/vehicles), comma four upgrades its driver assistance to openpilot, the [highest rated](https://data.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/consumer-reports-active-driving-assistance-systems-november-16-2020.pdf) driver assistance on the road today. With Experimental Mode, your Toyota, Hyundai, Ford, and more handle stop signs and red lights and slows down for curves. The built-in Wi-Fi and LTE ensure your comma four is ready to receive the latest over-the-air software updates.

#### One-Fifth the Size, All of the Power

<!-- 20% of comma 3X -->

In order to fit in the smaller footprint, comma four has a brand new mechanical and thermal design.
The triple camera 360° vision system fits entirely within the footprint of the 1.9" display, while the compute tucks out of sight behind the rearview mirror.

comma four features the Snapdragon 845 <span class="max-gradient">MAX</span>.
<!--The MAX cooling system on comma four achieves 4.5°C/W, a significant improvement over comma 3X's 7.5°C/W.-->
Our custom engineered <span class="max-gradient">MAX</span> cooling system unlocks continuous turbo performance and zero throttling in harsh windshield heat, while remaining completely silent.

<!--**Built for openpilot**

comma four comes ready to run openpilot, the world's [best](https://data.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/consumer-reports-active-driving-assistance-systems-november-16-2020.pdf) driver assistance system.

With the new 0.10 series, openpilot's end-to-end machine learning model learned to drive from 2.5 million minutes of driving examples from its 20,000 users.
openpilot's Experimental Mode also enables stop sign and traffic light handling, and with every update, it becomes more reliable.-->

#### Expressive New Interface

comma four introduces an entirely new user interface on its 300 PPI OLED touchscreen display.
The new interface also includes new alert sounds, enabled by a louder speaker that's now pointed towards the interior of the cabin.

#### Plug in & Drive in 5 minutes

We made the in-car setup even easier.
With the new form factor and increased mount surface area, the mount no longer needs the 48 hour cure time.
The most commonly installed software is also cached out of the box, so Wi-Fi is no longer necessary.
With comma four, you can now unbox, set up, and start driving in 5 minutes.

#### Designed in San Diego, Made in San Diego

Like comma 3X, comma four is manufactured, assembled, and fulfilled in our San Diego factory.
With 60% of the parts and half the steps of comma 3X, comma four is designed to be built at scale.

{% include figure.html url="/img/comma-four/revHbot.png" %}

comma four's factory includes new dual cellphone-grade SMT lines, featuring stencil and jet printing, vapor phase reflow, and 3D automated inspection.
We also developed Ultimate Provisioning, our new test fixture that unifies flashing, provisioning, and overnight stress testing.
