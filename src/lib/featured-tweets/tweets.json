I drove alongside thousands of other cars that probably had no idea this option was available to them. Well done, <a href=\"https://x.com/comma_ai\" target=\"_blank\">@comma_ai</a>"

It can keep you in lanes almost all the time, change lanes, adapt the speed, stop &amp; go in the traffic. It runs opensource openpilot which gets better every month."

Plus it works in way more cars. Assisted driving, for those of us that have used it, is much more relaxing. Especially on long drives over 3-4 hours. I love driving. But I feel more alert and rested when using assisted driving on long hauls."
