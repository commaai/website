            <div style="margin-left: 2rem">
              <strong>Before contacting support, first try these:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Reseat all connections and cables; see the <a href="/setup">setup guide</a>.</li>
                <li>Ensure there's no third party hardware installed, including the mount, harness, and any cables.</li>
                <li>Unplug the device for an hour to allow the device's supercapacitors to fully drain.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the issue occurs while running the latest openpilot release.  <b>We cannot look into issues while running forks or other software.</b></li>
                <li>Still having issues? Reflash the device to the factory default state with <a href="https://flash.comma.ai">flash.comma.ai</a>.</li>
              </ul>

              <strong>GPS issues?</strong>
              <p>
                Ensure there's nothing blocking the device's view of the sky.
                If you're still having issues, contact support and include a picture of the comma device on the windshield.
              </p>

              <strong>Issues after installing a fork?</strong>
              <p>
                Forks (aka third party software) can cause issues that may seem like hardware malfunctions, such as a blank screen or a fan malfunction.
                Use the instructions below to restore your device to stock.
              </p>

              <strong>Restore your device to stock</strong>
              <p>
                Support can only troubleshoot issues that occur while using stock comma hardware and software.
                </br></br>
                For hardware, ensure you are only using a harness, cable, and mounts from the comma shop.
                </br></br>
                For software, first reflash the device with <a href="https://flash.comma.ai">flash.comma.ai</a> to get the device to a clean factory state.
                Then, install the latest openpilot release using the "openpilot" button in the setup.
