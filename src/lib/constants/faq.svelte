          question: 'What is openpilot?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              comma openpilot is an open source driver-assistance system. Currently,
              openpilot performs the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and
              Automated Lane Centering (ALC) for compatible vehicles. It performs
              similarly to Tesla Autopilot and GM Super Cruise. openpilot can steer,
              accelerate, and brake automatically for other vehicles within its lane.
              Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to enforce driver alertness, openpilot includes a camera based
              Driver Monitoring (DM) system that alerts the driver when distracted or
              asleep. However, even with an attentive driver, we must make further efforts
              for the system to be safe. We have designed openpilot with two other safety
              considerations:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>The driver must always be capable to immediately retake manual control of
              the vehicle, by stepping on either pedal or by pressing the cancel button.</li>
              <li>The vehicle must not alter its trajectory too quickly for the driver to
              safely react. This means that while the system is engaged, the actuators are
              constrained to operate within reasonable limits.</li>
            </ol>
          `
        }, {
          question: 'How does openpilot work?',
          answer: `
            openpilot works by connecting to your car's CAN network. Most modern cars
            accept electronic steering, gas, and brake commands to allow for ADAS
            features. openpilot can use these commands to provide much better ADAS
            features than the car manufacturers can provide.
          `
        }, {
          question: 'Is my car compatible with openpilot?',
          answer: `
            A complete list of compatible vehicles can be found on our
            <a href="/vehicles">Compatibility page</a>.
          `
        }, {
          question: 'What should I buy to run openpilot in my car?',
          answer: `
            After verifying that your car is compatible, we recommend purchasing a comma
            device in our <a href="/shop">shop</a>. Don't forget to purchase a
            car harness to connect it to your vehicle. Add to cart, check out, and
            you’re good to go!
          `
        }, {
          question: 'Do I have to pay attention?',
          answer: `
            Yes, the driver must always be able to immediately retake manual control of
            the vehicle, by stepping on the brake pedal or by pressing the cancel
            button. When openpilot is engaged, a driver monitoring system actively
            tracks driver awareness to help prevent distractions. The openpilot system
            disengages if you are distracted. Drivers must keep their eyes on the road
            at all times and be ready to take control of the car.

        }, {
          question: 'What is the openpilot safety model?',

          question: 'What are the limitations of openpilot Automated Lane Centering?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              openpilot Automated Lane Centering (ALC) system does not automatically drive
              the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be paid to the area
              in front of the vehicle. The driver must always keep control of the steering
              wheel and be ready to correct the ALC system action at all times.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many factors can impact the performance of openpilot ALC, causing it to be
              unable to function as intended. These include, but are not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Poor visibility (heavy rain, snow, fog, etc.) or weather conditions are
              interfering with sensor operation.</li>
              <li>The road facing camera is obstructed, covered or damaged by mud, ice,
              snow, etc.</li>
              <li>Obstruction caused by applying excessive paint or adhesive products (such
              as wraps, stickers, rubber coating, etc.) onto the vehicle.</li>
              <li>The device is mounted incorrectly.</li>
              <li>When in sharp curves, like on-off ramps, intersections etc...; openpilot
              is designed to be limited in the amount of steering torque it can produce.</li>
              <li>In the presence of restricted lanes or construction zones.</li>
              <li>When driving on highly banked roads or in presence of strong cross-wind.</li>
              <li>Extremely hot or cold temperatures.</li>
              <li>Bright light (due to oncoming headlights, direct sunlight, etc.)</li>
              <li>Driving on hills, narrow, or winding roads.</li>

          question: 'What are the limitations of openpilot Adaptive Cruise Control?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              openpilot Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is not a system that allows careless
              or inattentive driving. It is still necessary for the driver to pay close
              attention to the vehicle’s surroundings and to be ready to re-take control
              of the gas and the brake at all times.

                When the posted speed limit is below the user selected set speed.
                openpilot does not detect speed limits at this time.
              </li>
              <li>In presence of vehicles in the same lane that are not moving.</li>
              <li>
                When abrupt braking maneuvers are required. openpilot is designed to be
                limited in the amount of deceleration and acceleration that it can produce.

          question: 'Do I retain my car factory safety features with openpilot installed?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              When openpilot is enabled in settings, Lane Keep Assist (LKAS), and
              Automated Lane Centering (ALC) are replaced by openpilot lateral control and
              only function when openpilot is engaged. Lane Departure Warning (LDW) works
              whether engaged or disengaged.
            </p>
            <p>
              On certain cars, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is replaced by openpilot
              longitudinal control.

          question: 'Does openpilot support manual transmission cars (with the driver shifting)?',
          answer: `
            On certain cars, manual transmissions are supported if they have the packages
            listed in the compatibility table. If you’d like to learn more, join us on
            <a href="https://discord.comma.ai/">Discord</a>, where some of our members are supporting
            manual cars.
          `
        }, {
          question: 'How does openpilot recognize the car model it is connected to?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              If your car is on the list of supported cars, openpilot will automatically
              recognize the model of your car by performing a scan of relevant ECU
              firmware versions present in your car. The presence of certain ECU firmware
              versions is an indication of the model year, car brand, car model, and trim.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your car isn’t recognized as supported, your device will fall back to a
              dashcam only mode, preserving the stock functionalities and the user will
              receive a notification on the screen.
            </p>
          `
        }, {
          question: 'How do I update openpilot?',
          answer: `
            All software updates are received over-the-air (OTA). openpilot will
            automatically check for updates when connected to the internet. Your device
            will notify you on the screen when an update is available and prompt you to
            reboot the device to complete the update. You may also manually check for
            updates in the settings, under the "software" tab.
          `
        }, {
          question: 'Will all versions of openpilot work with my comma device?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              The comma 3X can only run openpilot 0.9.4 and above. Running earlier versions
              requires making modifications to the software so that a newer AGNOS is installed.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you face issues after installing an older version of openpilot, you can
              re-flash AGNOS on your device by following the instructions at
              <a href="https://flash.comma.ai">flash.comma.ai</a>.

          `
        }, {
          question: 'Does openpilot work at all speeds?',
          answer: `
            Supported speeds vary depending on the car. Please reference the supported
            car list for vehicle specific speed limitations. Maximum speed is the same
            as the maximum speed that stock ACC can be set to (car dependent) with a
            hard limit at ~92mph.
          `
        }, {
          question: 'Does openpilot work outside of the United States of America?',
          answer: `
            Yes, openpilot is not region locked and can be used in any country. You are
            responsible for complying with local laws and regulations.
          `
        }, {
          question: 'What is a fingerprint?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              A fingerprint is the method openpilot uses to determine which vehicle it is
              connected to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Current methods use vehicle ECU firmware logging. openpilot will fingerprint
              the vehicle on each start up.
            </p>
            <p>
              If openpilot detects a firmware version not previously logged, it will need
              to be added to the codebase. Guides on adding new firmware can be found
              <a href="https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki/Fingerprinting">here</a>.

              Congratulations! Get started by watching the Installation Guide on our
              <a  href="/setup">setup page</a>. We find on average the installation process takes 15-30

          question: 'Does installing a comma device require permanent modifications to the car?',
          answer: `
            Installing a comma device does not require any permanent modifications to
            your car. With the car harness, most car trims remain in place.

        }, {
          question: 'How do I mount my comma device?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              We recommend the mount be centered on the windshield below the trim (see pictures in the Installation Guide). Be sure to leave enough room to remove the trim in the future. First, clean the windshield with the included alcohol wipe. Ensure the top of the mount is fully visible from the driver’s seat. Adhere mount: peel off the 3M tape’s cover on the mount. Press firmly in the center of the mount, then the edges to ensure no bubbles form.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let the mount cure: the mount must cure for 48 hours before installing the comma device. Skipping this step will compromise the integrity of the mount.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 3X mount may be difficult to slide onto the device before it’s installed on the windshield. This is expected and will be easier to do once the mount is installed and fully cured. Some force may be necessary to initially slide the device on the mount. Before applying any force, ensure the device mount is parallel to the mount on the windshield so it will slide in correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              IT IS THE USER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO MOUNT THE DEVICE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND ORDINANCES.

            <p>
              From the FTC website: "Simply using an aftermarket or recycled part does not
              void your warranty. The Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act makes it illegal for
              companies to void your warranty or deny coverage under the warranty simply

              Contact your insurance provider directly; insurance coverage is between the
              user and their insurance provider. comma hardware users have been able to
              get coverage and discuss this on Reddit

              Insurance companies are beginning to understand the safety benefits of ADAS

              rejecting coverage to comma hardware users.

          question: 'What is the body?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              comma body is “the future of people.” You buy a comma body, buy a comma
              3X (the head), attach the comma 3X to the body, and watch it come
              to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that in order to solve AI, for most people’s definition, you
              must be embedded in the real world. We define AI as a machine that can
              do every task at least as well as a human. And in order to do human
              tasks, it helps a lot to have a human like body. The comma body is the
              beginning of that journey.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today it’s a mobile platform for the comma 3X, but we will be
              building a knee and arms for it. Like everything we do, we try to
              distill the problem down to its essence, so unlike some companies, we
              aren’t focused on the humanoid shape. Wheels are a fine form of
              locomotion for cooking and cleaning, the dream tasks of the comma body.
              Two arms, a knee, and a comma 3X should complete a comma person (sold
              separately, knee and arm coming in 2023).
            </p>

        }, {
          question: 'What software does it run?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              The comma body runs openpilot! From openpilot's perspective, the comma
              body is a car. It runs the same camera and logging software, so we'll
              be able to learn from the fleet of bodies in the same way we learn from
              our fleet of cars.
            </p>
            <p>
              At launch, the software will balance the body (using the same localizer
              as the car!) and allow you to drive it around via web interface. Shortly
              we’ll add video streaming to that web interface, allowing you to drive
              your body outside line of sight. We’d also like to add a VR app to drive
              the body from a first person view, this will be needed by the time we
              ship the arms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once we start getting data back from our body fleet, we can train
              models. The first model we will train (jointly with the driving model!)
              is a posenet, allowing inside out position tracking. When this model is
              shipped, the localizer will change from 3-DoF to 6-DoF. And once the
              dead reckoning is similar quality to what we have on the cars, adding a
              SLAM system will be very simple to allow drift free localization in
              your environment.

If you damage your screen we offer repairs for $200 or you can purchase a replacement screen in our shop for $100 (DIY at your own risk). If we receive a damaged device returned to us we will deduct the cost of the repair from your return.

Most delayed USPS orders do eventually arrive within a few days. If this is UPS and the device was signed for, there is little we can do on our end as this is considered a closed matter. If your UPS package was not delivered, please check tracking to see if your order may be at a UPS pickup location. If the order is shown as being returned to the comma warehouse, we will refund it and we recommend that you place a new order.

              It is our policy for a comma engineer to root cause every hardware issue, for both our understanding of any hardware failures and to provide you with the best experience.
              A route on the latest stock openpilot is necessary before a ticket is sent to an engineer for review.

          question: 'How do you replace the SIM card in a comma 3X?',
          answer: `
            <p>
              All comma 3Xs (shipped in the US) come with a SIM card. The SIM slot is a
              push/pull mechanism, where you must push on the card to release it and then
              guide it out.

              <div class="video-container">

              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              Make sure your SIM is inserted correctly by following the step-by-step guide
              below:

              <figure>
                <img src=${CommaThreeSimInsertionImage.img.src} alt="steps to insert comma 3X SIM card">
              </figure>
            </p>

            <strong>How to replace the SIM card in a comma 3X</strong>

            <ol>
              <li>With the comma 3X off and unplugged, tap/push the SIM card with the
              big SIM card, credit card, or other narrow hard object to release the SIM
              (you will hear a click).</li>
              <li>Gently pull the SIM card from the SIM slot (try tweezers)</li>
              <li>Push the SIM card into the SIM slot (with the metal contacts facing
              downwards) with your fingernail or plastic card until you hear a click or
              reach resistance. If you've done this step correctly, the SIM card should
              stay completely recessed inside the comma 3X.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We recommend you clean the camera lenses with a microfiber cloth before
              using the comma 3X again.
            </p>
            <strong>How to activate the new SIM card</strong>
            <p>
              Once your new SIM card is installed, your comma 3X will need to connect
              to Wi-Fi to activate the SIM card. Best ways to get your comma 3X online:
              hotspot from your phone, bring your car somewhere with Wi-Fi or connect your
              comma 3X to a USB charger in a place with Wi-Fi. Your comma 3X
              requires about 5 minutes of Wi-Fi connection and then can take up to 30
              minutes to activate and might require a reboot. You will know the activation
              started when the device displays "CONNECT ONLINE".
            </p>
            <p>
              After the next reboot, your SIM card should connect to the internet and you
              should have prime again!
            </p>

            We recommend first trying to reflash your device at <a href="https://flash.comma.ai">flash.comma.ai</a> and to reseat all the cable connections. comma support is only able to look into issues on stock with a route where the issue occurs.
